# N-Puzzle Solver

This Java-based project solves the N-Puzzle problem using the A* algorithm. The puzzle can be configured for any size, but the solver is optimized for the 8-Puzzle. The project includes an interactive way to visualize the puzzle and its solution.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `Main.java`: The main entry point for running the solver.
  - `PuzzleSolver.java`: Contains the logic for solving the puzzle using A*.
  - `Puzzle.java`: Defines the N-Puzzle state and methods for manipulating tiles.
- `bin/`: Contains compiled class files.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Features

- Configurable N-Puzzle size.
- A* algorithm for solving the 8-Puzzle.
- Puzzle state visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files: `javac src/*.java`.
3. Run the main program: `java Main`.
